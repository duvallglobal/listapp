recommended price being prominent.
Adjust price estimations based on item condition (AI-assessed).
Marketplace Recommendation System:
Analyze suitability of top platforms (Google Shopping, Facebook
Marketplace, eBay, Poshmark, Xtrader, etc.) for the identified item
category and price point.
Calculate estimated commission/seller fees for each recommended
platform. Fee data must be kept reasonably current.
